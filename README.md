This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that offers a user-friendly interface and interactive experience for players. Designed using HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for game logic, it provides a dynamic gameplay experience in a browser.

Features:

Responsive Game Board: A visually appealing 3x3 grid designed with CSS, complete with subtle gradients, shadow effects, and hover animations to enhance interactivity.
Player Interaction: Alternates turns between two players (X and O) while tracking each move and ensuring each cell can only be selected once per game.
Win and Draw Detection: Automatically checks for a winning combination after each move, declaring a winner when three identical symbols align. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.
Game Reset and Replay: Includes buttons to reset the game board or start a new game, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for players.
The project focuses on a smooth user interface and intuitive gameplay, combining aesthetics with functional elements to create a polished and enjoyable Tic-Tac-Toe game.
